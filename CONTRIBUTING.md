## Where to Contribute

### Picking an Issue 
Any issue tagged with the `ready` or `bug` labels and **not** marked with the `taken` label are up for grabs. 
Some notes on labeling (short descriptions also accessible [here](https://github.com/UVM-CS-Crew/crew-bot/labels)):

- documentation
  - Improvements or addition to documentation, both in code and in supporting documents in the repo.
- good first issue
  - issues meant for newer devs / devs of any level new to the repo
- improvement
  - kind of a catch all at the momment, the improvement label... needs improvement...

### Discussion

Feel free to discuss/drop notes in the issue comments on **any** issue, however discussion is *especially* beneficial on issues tagged with `feature request`, `investigation`, `question`, and `help wanted`.
