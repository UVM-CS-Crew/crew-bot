# Contributing

See general but comphrensive guides to contributing [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-definitive-guide-to-contributing-to-open-source-900d5f9f2282/) & [here](http://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).
Before making your first pull request or opening an issue, please read this document thoroughly and consider browsing the linked resources.

## Conduct

We expect community members and contributors to abide to our code of conduct (coming soon!). All activity and conversations across issues, pull requests, commits, etc. must be respectful, inclusive, void of harassment, and appropriate. If you believe anyone's actions or behavior has violated the code of conduct or was inappropriate in any shape or form, please reach out to a current CS Crew admin.


## Where to Contribute

### Picking an Issue 
Any issue tagged with the `ready` or `bug` labels and **not** marked with the `taken` label are up for grabs. 
Some notes on labeling (short descriptions also accessible [here](https://github.com/UVM-CS-Crew/crew-bot/labels)):

- documentation
  - Improvements or addition to documentation, both in code and in supporting documents in the repo.
- good first issue
  - issues meant for newer devs / devs of any level new to the repo
- improvement
  - kind of a catch all at the momment, the improvement label... needs improvement...

### Discussion

Feel free to discuss/drop notes in the issue comments on **any** issue, however discussion is *especially* beneficial on issues tagged with `feature request`, `investigation`, `question`, and `help wanted`. 


## How to Contribute

### Code

Clone the repository, create a feature/bugfix branch formatted with your netid, issue number, and a meaningul name. For example: `NETID/feature-or-bug-name-1234`.
Use meaningful commit messages when commiting your code. If you feel it necessary you may squash your commits / adopt any interim workflow, so long as the branch name follows the format and commits are meaningful. 
Once you are ready, push your branch and create a pull request! Make sure to tag your issue in your PR so it will be closed when the PR is merged.

PRs without an associated issue will still be considered but when applicable please create an issue first.

An admin or otherwise designated community members will review PRs.

### Opening Issues

Something could be better, or is plain broken? Start by checking if the issue / topic already exists as an issue. If so, leave thoughts in the comments - generating conversation will build traction and help get an issuse noticed.
If the issue doesn't already exist, feel free to create a new one. An admin will triage created issues and reserves the right to delete it if it breaks the code of conduct.

When creating an issue try to keep the name short and meaningful. Use the description to go into as much detail as needed, and then some.
Do your best to appropriately tag your issue (see labels in repo for best use cases). As mentioned, an admin will go through and make tweaks if necessary.

### Stale Issues

Issues that have been claimed (with the `taken` label) that either...
- remain inactive for too long after being claimed
- the user claiming the issue has communicated they no longer wish to work on it
- the user claiming the issue violated the code of conduct
...will have the label/user assignment cleared and reassessed if much time has passed before being marked as `ready` again.


That is all we have for now! Thank you for reading and good luck!
